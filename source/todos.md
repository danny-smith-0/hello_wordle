# Hello Wordle TO-DOs

- TODO Make a CLI so that I don't have to recompile after every guess
- TODO Check what words (valid answers or guesses) have triplicate letters. Geese is one. Hopefully is only a guess, not an answer.
- TODO If necessary, make code handle triplicate letters.
- TODO refactor `calc_buckets()`
- TODO Break the code into different files, potentially refactoring into separate classes
- TODO BUG. Black duplicate assumes that I have a green. Need black duplicate for a yellow.
