# Hello Wordle TO-DOs

- TODO Make code handle triplicate letters. 20 of 2315 answers have triplicates
- TODO BUG. Black duplicate assumes that I have a green. Need black duplicate for a yellow. - Probably not necessary anymore
   - TODO Remove these functions entirely
- TODO Separate Spanish answers from guesses
- TODO Add guesses if guessed (helpful overall. Necessary for Spanish, because of cutoff)
- TODO condition variables
- TODO Actually calculate how many guesses to get to the bottom, instead of approximating it with # of words
