# Hello Wordle TO-DOs

- TODO Make a CLI so that I don't have to recompile after every guess
- TODO Make code handle triplicate letters. 20 of 2315 answers have triplicates
- TODO Break the code into different files, potentially refactoring into separate classes
- TODO BUG. Black duplicate assumes that I have a green. Need black duplicate for a yellow.
