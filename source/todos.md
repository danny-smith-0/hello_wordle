# Hello Wordle TO-DOs

## Older ones

- TODO Make code handle triplicate letters. 20 of 2315 answers have triplicates
- TODO Separate Spanish answers from guesses
- These two are the same:
  - TODO Add guesses if guessed (helpful overall. Necessary for Spanish, because of cutoff)
  - TODO if I guess a word without a saved bucket, calculate it
- These two are the same:
  - TODO Actually calculate how many guesses to get to the bottom, instead of approximating it with # of words
  - TODO Don't use "number of words remaining" as a metric to say how close you are to finishing. Hard mode can mess that up. Move forward to beyond that guess to see how many guesses it would take in the worst case

## Newer ones

- TODO Add some stuff for nerdle. MVP: generate all possible answers and an analysis
- TODO New scoring method. Iterate through so it doesn't have to use bucket size as a proxy variable
- TODO If I guess a word that doesn't have its buckets calculated (a guess, not an answer), calculate its buckets please. Helpful overall. Necessary for Spanish because of cutoff
- TODO CAN I USE THIS ON MY PHONE SOMEHOW?
  - use github website thingy? `https://pages.github.com/`

Retain previous inputs (all, especially dont)
Triplicate suuuuper important for nerdle
