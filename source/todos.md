# Hello Wordle TO-DOs

## Older ones

- TODO Make code handle triplicate letters. 20 of 2315 answers have triplicates
- TODO Separate Spanish answers from guesses

## Newer ones

- TODO Add some stuff for nerdle. MVP: generate all possible answers and an analysis
- TODO New scoring method. Iterate through so it doesn't have to use bucket size as a proxy variable
- TODO Add safeties if I put garbage in. Let me try again instead of crashing
- TODO If I guess a word that doesn't have its buckets calculated (a guess, not an answer), calculate its buckets please. Helpful overall. Necessary for Spanish because of cutoff
- TODO CAN I USE THIS ON MY PHONE SOMEHOW?
  - use github website thingy? `https://pages.github.com/`
