# Hello Wordle TO-DOs

- TODO Make code handle triplicate letters. 20 of 2315 answers have triplicates
- TODO BUG. Black duplicate assumes that I have a green. Need black duplicate for a yellow. - Probably not necessary anymore
  - TODO Remove these functions entirely
- TODO Separate Spanish answers from guesses
- TODO Add guesses if guessed (helpful overall. Necessary for Spanish, because of cutoff)
- TODO condition variables
- TODO Actually calculate how many guesses to get to the bottom, instead of approximating it with # of words

## Reset 2022-08

- Rename the executable to hello_world
- Add some stuff for nerdle. MVP: generate all possible answers and an analysis
- NEEEEEWW scoring method. It iterates through so it doesn't have to use bucket size as a proxy variable
- Add safeties if I put garbage in. Let me try again instead of crashing
- If I guess a word that doesn't have its buckets calculated (a guess, not an answer), calculate its buckets please
- CAN I USE THIS ON MY PHONE SOMEHOW?
  - use github website thingy? `https://pages.github.com/`
