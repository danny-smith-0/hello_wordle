# Hello Wordle TO-DOs

- TODO Make code handle triplicate letters. 20 of 2315 answers have triplicates
- TODO BUG. Black duplicate assumes that I have a green. Need black duplicate for a yellow. - Probably not necessary anymore
   - TODO Remove these functions entirely
- TODO Separate Spanish answers from guesses
- TODO Add guesses if guessed (helpful overall. Necessary for Spanish, because of cutoff)
- TODO condition variables
- TODO Actually calculate how many guesses to get to the bottom, instead of approximating it with # of words
- TODO if I guess a word without a saved bucket, calculate it
- TODO Don't use "number of words remaining" as a metric to say how close you are to finishing. Hard mode can mess that up. Move forward to beyond that guess to see how many guesses it would take in the worst case
- TODO Add safeties for the inputs
